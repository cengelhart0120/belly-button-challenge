# <p align="center">Module 14 Challenge: Interactive Visualizations with JavaScript and Plotly
## Data Analytics assignment to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)
### Overview
1. Read in data
2. Create dropdown menu to choose study participant
3. Create interactive charts to display data about the selected participant's belly button microbiome
### Features
1. Use the D3 library in JavaScript to read in the `samples.json` file from the provided [URL](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json)
2. Create requisite bar, bubble, and gauge charts using Plotly, as well as a demographic information card, that initialize automatically when a live server is opened from the `index.html` file, or when the app's [website](https://cengelhart0120.github.io/belly-button-challenge/) is accessed
3. Create a dropdown menu of all available study participants, and automatically update the charts and card when a new participant is selected
4. Deploy the app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages
### Prerequisites
#### Basic
- Familiarity with and use of a web browser, to access the app's [website](https://cengelhart0120.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)
#### Advanced
- Familiarity with and use of the following, to explore the `app.js` and `index.html` files in the repo:
    - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
    - [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
    - [D3.js](https://devdocs.io/d3~7/)
    - [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
    - A code editing program, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - A development local server with live reload for static and dynamic pages, such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code
### Usage
- Download the contents of the repo (as they are) to the same directory
- Open and explore the files if desired (`samples.json` contains the data read-in via D3, for reference)
- To interact with the app, open `index.html`, right-click anywhere in the code, and select `Open with Live Server`
    - The default web browser should open to the app
- Have fun exploring/playing around with the data/code! What are some ways the code could be made more clear or efficient?
